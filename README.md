# 🦀 Learning Rust — Daily Progress

This repository documents my **day-by-day learning journey with Rust**, following  
📘 *The Rust Programming Language* (commonly known as **the Rust Book**).

The goal of this repo is to:
- Learn Rust **concept by concept**
- Practice each topic with **working code**
- Maintain **daily notes** for revision and clarity
- Build a strong foundation in **safe, performant systems programming**

---

## 📚 Learning Source

- **Primary Resource:** The Rust Programming Language (Official Rust Book)
- **Approach:**  
  - Read one section/chapter daily  
  - Implement concepts immediately in code  
  - Write concise notes in Markdown
